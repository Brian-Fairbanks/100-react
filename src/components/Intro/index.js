          Hello, My name is Brian Fairbanks
        </p>

        <p>
          In an attempt to work on many different things, and expand my web development abilities, I have started this
          page
          to write 1 project each day for 100 days.
        </p>

        <p>
          Admittedly, some of these projects have not turned out quite as well as I would have liked -- They may have a
          bug or 2 in the UI,
          or may not be 100% finished, such as with the Pong demonstration. That is the risk I take when I alot myself
          only 1 day for each.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thank you for checking out my 100 days of coding project!
        </p>
